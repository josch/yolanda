many. see http://yolanda.mister-muffin.de/trac

Yolanda-upload is full of bad programming, severely unsafe and not fit for general use. Use on hacker conferences like the Chaos Communication Congress is encouraged - but please, for the love of the invisible pink unicorn, submit tickets in our bug tracking system afterwards.
